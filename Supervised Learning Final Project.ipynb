    "# Let's Watch a Movie!\n",
    "I love watching movies, but sometimes it can be hard to decide what to watch. I might be in the mood for an action movie like The Matrix, but I can’t seem to think of a title to watch. Thankfully, we can use machine learning to help us, using the power of recommender systems! \n",
    "A recommender system is an information filtering system that seeks to predict the most relevant item to a user. There are a handful of different kinds of recommendation systems, but the one that we will be focusing on will be Content-Based Filtering. This is filtering that uses the features of an item in order to recommend similar ones to the user. We will be utilizing two popular approaches to content-based filtering: a k-nearest neighbors algorithm and cosine similarity.<br><br> \n",
    "In this project, we will attempt to design our own recommender system that provides us with movie recommendations. These recommendations will be based on a movie we give to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to design and implement a successful movie recommender system. We will attempt two different approaches and compare how each system performs. Additionally, I hope to gain more insight how these systems are developed and learn about ways to improve them. I think recommender systems are fascinating and I think it's important to know the inner workings of these systems that we interact with every day. <br><br>\n",

    "The dataset we will be utilizing will be:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.(2017)*https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata, &nbsp; Author unknown\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This is a public version of The Movie Database’s (https://www.themoviedb.org/) dataset that includes metadata on roughly 5,000 movies. This metadata was generated by users of the website and includes things like movie titles, ratings, genre, etc. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two files in this dataset,tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv. They are 5.4 MB and 38.1 MB, respectively. \n",
    "<br>In the movies csv, there are 4,803 samples with 20 features. The datatypes of these features is 7 numerical and 13 categorical. Some of the key features include **title**, **keywords**, and **genres**.\n",
    "<br>In the credits csv, there are also 4,803 samples but there are only 4 features. This includes: **title**, **cast**, and **crew** which are categorical features, and **movie_id** which is numerical.\n",

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "Now let's clean our data! This dataset has a lot of interesting characteristics, but it's not quite ready for our purposes yet. We will be cleaning the data by going through the following steps:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Consolidating the two csv's into one single data frame. This will make it easier to move forward in our exploratory data analysis. </li>\n",
    "<li>Remove the features that will not be relevant to our future model.</li>\n",
    "<li>Observe features with null values and decide whether to drop or impute.</li> \n",
